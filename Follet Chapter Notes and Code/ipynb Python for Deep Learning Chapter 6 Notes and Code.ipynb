The remainder of the problem is that SimpleRNN isn’t good at processing long sequences, such as text. Other types of recurrent layers perform much better. Let’s look at some more-advanced layers.\"\n",

    " \n",
    "In addition to SimpleRNN, keras also includes LSTM and GRU layers for RNNs. SimpleRNN can't actually learn long-term dependencies due to the *vanishing gradient problem*.\n",
    " \n",
    "***The vanishing gradient problem***: as you keep adding layers to the network, the network eventually becomes untraineable. (For the theory behind this, see Yoshua Bengio, Patrice Simard, and Paolo Frasconi, “Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent Is Difficult,” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 5, no. 2 (1994).)\n",

    " \n",
    "LSTM stands for *Long Short-Term Memory* algorithm (see Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber, “Long Short-Term Memory,” Neural Computation 9, no. 8 (1997).). LSTM essentially works as a \"conveyor belt\" that sequence info can jump onto, preserving it for later use and protecting the signals from gradually vanishing during processing. See the book for helpful diagrams showing the process.\n",
    " \n",
    "So, where the SimpleRNN used the ouput of the current sequence as the state for the next sequence, the LSTM creates a \"carry\" values (Ct) that combines with the input and recurrent connections at each cell to affect that state as it's sent to the next timestamp.\n",
    " \n",
    "It does this via three transformations, all of which work like SimpleRNN layers, but with distinct weight matrices (i, f, and k).\n",

    "Listing 6.25 Pseudocode details of the LSTM architecture\n",
